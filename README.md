<h1>Team 7154 FRC RIO Code -- 2024</h1>
<p>Our code is mostly complete. We need to finish writing more autonomous commands and add a climb sequence. Before our second competition, we plan to program a Jetson Xavier with an object detection model to track notes, and we will update our intake command accordingly to use this data. We may also add AprilTag odometry updates in the future for more reliable autonomous.</p>

<p>The robot contains the following physical subsystems</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swerve Drivetrain</li>
  <li>Elevator</li>
  <li>Pivot</li>
  <li>Intake</li>
  <li>Shooter</li>
</ul>

<p>In our code, we also added CompetitionData and Limelight subsystems to display data on Elastic Dashboard (or Shuffleboard). We highly recommand using Elastic Dashboard, which can be accessed using this <a href="https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
