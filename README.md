<h1>Team 7154 FRC RIO Code -- 2024</h1>
<p>Our code is mostly complete. We need to finish writing more autonomous commands and quickly adding a climb sequence. Before our second competition, we plan to program a Jetson Xavier with an object detection model to track notes and will update our intake command accordingly. We may also add AprilTag odometry updates in the future.</p>

<p>The robot contains the following physical subsystems</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swerve Drivetrain</li>
  <li>Elevator</li>
  <li>Pivot</li>
  <li>Intake</li>
  <li>Shooter</li>
</ul>

<p>In our code, we also added CompetitionData and Limelight subsystems to display data on Elastic Dashboard (or Shuffleboard)</p>
